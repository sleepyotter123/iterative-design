<h1 id="iterative-design"><a href="#iterative-design">Iterative Design</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>To practice iterative design, our team of 4 created a prototype <strong>tablet app</strong> for <a href="https://heptabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Heptabase</strong></a>, a <strong>visual note-taking tool</strong> that helps you learn <strong>complex topics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></h2>
<p>We attempted to solve the same problem that Heptabase&#x27;s developers were trying to solve, based only on their <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/heptabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description</a> on YCombinator. This left us with <strong>three success criteria</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our solution must involve putting notes on whiteboards;</li>
<li>It must allow users to search through their notes to support visual recall; and</li>
<li>It should ultimately support a user&#x27;s ability to learn complex topics.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ideation"><a href="#ideation">Ideation</a></h2>
<p>To kickstart our design process, we first drew up several <strong>sketches</strong> for potential interfaces. In these, we explored a few <strong>design alternatives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <strong>centered</strong> our <strong>user flows</strong> around either a home screen, a files page, or a whiteboard;</li>
<li>We considered different <strong>primary screen orientations</strong>;</li>
<li>We varied <strong>tool</strong> and <strong>menu placement</strong>, between having toolbars on page margins, buttons that reveal slide-out menus, and icons on notes themselves; and</li>
<li>We laid out our <strong>file views</strong> in different ways (in grids/lists, with/without thumbnails, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image-wrapper"><div class="image-grid" style="--target-width:150%;grid-template-columns:minmax(0, 0.5136363636363637fr) minmax(0, 0.4681818181818182fr) minmax(0, 0.7706013363028953fr) minmax(0, 0.5142045454545454fr);--border:1px solid var(--edge-color)"><a href="/iterative-design/sketch-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/sketch-1.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/sketch-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/sketch-2.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/sketch-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/sketch-3.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/sketch-4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/sketch-4.png" alt="TODO"/></a></div><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Our sketches. Click on any image to open it in a new tab.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>We then <strong>distilled</strong> our sketches into a number of key featuresâ€”ones which we felt would allow our ideal note-taking app to better support learning:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Multi-Modal User Input</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Our app should support both <strong>free-hand writing/drawing</strong> and <strong>typed text</strong>, as users absorb content most effectively through different mediums.</li>
<li>It should also provide a way to <strong>quickly jot down notes</strong> with similar levels of flexibility, so that important information isn&#x27;t missed due to UI inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Organization</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The folder system should be as <strong>unopinionated</strong> as possible, to prevent constraining the user to a certain way of organizing (like OneNote does, with its pages/sections).</li>
<li>There should also be ways to <strong>side-step bad organization</strong>, e.g. search, quick access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we refined our sketches into <strong>wireframes</strong> incorporating the above features:</p>
<figure class="image-wrapper"><div class="image-grid" style="--target-width:150%"><a href="/iterative-design/wireframe-login.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/wireframe-login.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/wireframe-main.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/wireframe-main.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/wireframe-files.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/wireframe-files.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/wireframe-search.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/wireframe-search.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/wireframe-napkin.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/wireframe-napkin.png" alt="TODO"/></a></div><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Our wireframes.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="prototyping--iteration"><a href="#prototyping--iteration">Prototyping &amp; Iteration</a></h2>
<p>In order to begin iterating on our design, we first had to have something to show, to collect feedback. Thus, we developed an <strong>interactive, high-fidelity prototype</strong> in Figma:</p>
<figure class="image-wrapper"><div class="image-grid" style="--target-width:150%"><a href="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-login.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-login.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-whiteboard.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-whiteboard.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-textedit.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-textedit.png" alt="TODO"/></a><a href="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-search.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/iterative-design/prototype-initial-search.png" alt="TODO"/></a></div><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Our initial prototype.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, having received feedback from fellow UX practitioners, we made a round of <strong>revisions</strong> addressing the main points brought up in their critiques:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>App Navigation</strong>
<ul>
<li>[Feedback] Reviewers didn&#x27;t expect to be sent to a whiteboard right after logging in.</li>
<li>[Improvement] To provide a <em>better mental model of app navigation</em>, we modified our app to instead direct users to the <strong>files page</strong>, which now acts as a <strong>home screen</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Feature Learnability</strong>
<ul>
<li>[Feedback] It was unclear what snippets were for and how to use them.</li>
<li>[Improvement] To enhance learnability, we added <strong>instructional placeholder text</strong> to new snippets to help explain their purpose and usage to first-time users and testers. We also added a <strong>new user flow</strong> to our prototype.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>File &amp; Folder Creation</strong>
<ul>
<li>[Feedback] It wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious how new files, folders, etc. could be created.</li>
<li>[Improvement] We added a <strong>&quot;create&quot; section</strong> to the files page (accessible also from the files overlay), which allows users to more efficiently create new whiteboards, folders, and/or snippets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prototype Representativeness</strong>
<ul>
<li>[Feedback] Reviewers commented that our prototype&#x27;s file structure was improbably clean, and wanted to see how we would deal with more &quot;realistic&quot; scenarios: e.g. multiple nested folders.</li>
<li>[Improvement] We included more representative files and folders, and added <strong>nested folder navigation</strong> + <strong>scrollability</strong> to the prototype. This allowed us to demo a more intensive file structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="user-testing"><a href="#user-testing">User Testing</a></h2>
<p>As a last step, we also sent our prototype to <a href="https://usertesting.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UserTesting.com</a> to obtain feedback from users outside of the Brown University Community. Their recordings can be found below:</p>

</ul></details>
<p>As our app&#x27;s <strong>main functionality</strong> centered on multi-modal note-taking and flexible organization, we asked our testers to complete tasks using features relevant to those goals.</p>
<p>Specifically, we provided them with the following instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Find the &quot;Demo Whiteboard&quot;, and add a textbox somewhere near its top-left corner.</li>
<li>You remember that you took notes on a specific term several weeks ago and want to review them. Use the Search functionality to search for the term &quot;Lorem Ipsum.&quot;</li>
<li>You have a brilliant idea that you want to write down immediately without creating a new whiteboard. Create and save a new &quot;Snippet&quot; to record your thoughts.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#x27;s a summary of our findings from those user tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users found the home page to be <strong>intuitive</strong>, <strong>clean</strong>, and <strong>easy to navigate</strong>.</li>
<li>Users <strong>quickly figured out</strong> how to add textboxes and perform searches, as the icons we used for them conveyed their meaning effectively.</li>
<li>Creating snippets took the most time, as our users <strong>didn&#x27;t know what a snippet was</strong>, nor how to create one.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings aligned with our expectations. We emphasized simplicity in our interfaces, so icons played a heavy role in communicating their functionality. Because snippets are a novel concept, and its icon was poorly chosen, it made sense that users struggled with that task.</p>
<p>For our next iteration, we&#x27;d like to incorporate an in-app tutorial, in the form of a series of short animatics, to provide first-time users with more clarity. We&#x27;d also experiment with different icons for our snippets overlay, possibly changing its placement altogether to improve noticeability and access.</p>

<p>We believe that our app somewhat achieves its goal of being a <strong>visual note-taking tool</strong> that helps users <strong>learn complex topics</strong>â€”doing so by supporting <strong>multi-modal user input</strong> and enabling <strong>flexible organization</strong>. It goes without saying, though, that there is still plenty of room for iteration and improvement!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Through this project, our team came up with a new design for an app based only on a startup&#x27;s description. We refined sketches and wireframes into interactive prototypes, made improvements based on collected feedback, and conducted user testing.</p>
<p>All told, it was good practice! 4 out of 5 dentists agree that <strong>iteration</strong> is central to good design, after all; though, it&#x27;s a shame we didn&#x27;t actually do multiple <em>rounds</em> of it this time.</p>
